# Purpose and Scope

This document describes how third-party software can connect to the Buildbotics CNC controller (Controller) over a network connection and control and monitor the controller remotely.  The document is written for software developers intending to write such third-party software.  It has been kept brief as the details are documented thoroughly in the referenced documentation.  The following sections provide an overview of the interface and its documentation.

# Interface Overview

Third-party clients may connect to the Buildbotics Controller either via the hardwired Ethernet port or an 802.11 Wifi connection.  Using this network connection the controller's web interface may be accessed by navigating to the controller's network address.  For example, at http://bbctrl.local/.  Making such a connection is described in the [Buildbotics User Manual](https://buildbotics.com/manual).

Over this network channel, it is also possible to access the controller programmatically using both the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.  The API for the HTTP interface is described in the document  [Buildbotics Controller API Reference](https://api.buildbotics.com/).  The API for the WebSocket interface is described in [Buildbotics Controller WebSocket API](https://api.buildbotics.com/Websocket_API.md).  Using these APIs you can upload CNC program files (GCode), start, stop and pause programs and monitor program progress as well as the status of many other parts of the Buildbotics controller.

# Typical Usage Scenario

In the typical use case, third-party software would first establish a WebSocket connection as described in [Buildbotics Controller WebSocket API](https://api.buildbotics.com/Websocket_API.md).  This provides access to a continuously updated JSON state object from the controller.  The variables of the state object are described in [Buildbotics Controller API Reference](https://api.buildbotics.com/) with additional variables in [Buildbotics Controller Configuration Variables](https://api.buildbotics.com/Config_Variables.md) and [Buildbotics Controller Internal Variables](https://api.buildbotics.com/Internal_Variables.md).

Next a GCode file may be uploaded via the filesystem interface with an HTTP PUT request to the ``/api/fs/{path}`` endpoint where ``{path}`` is the target file name.  Next an HTTP PUT to ``/api/start/{path}`` the program.  The program can be paused vai ``/api/pause`` and stopped with ``/api/stop``.  All the while, the status can be monitored via the state object.

The API also allows for jogging the machine via ``/api/jog`` and homing the machine via ``/api/home``.

# Configuring the Controller

There are many configuration options which control the machine's performance and limits.  These may be modified programmatically by downloading a copy of the current configuration via a GET request to ``/api/load``, modifying the resulting JSON data and uploading the changes via a PUT request to ``/api/save``.  Saving the config however, requires API authorization as described below.  Configuration variables are described in [Buildbotics Controller Configuration Variables](https://api.buildbotics.com/Config_Variables.md).

# API Authorization

Authorization is only required for a few administrative operations such as uploading a new configuration file.  Authorization is achieved by setting an HTTP cookie with the name ``bbctrl-sid`` to the value of the state variable ``sid`` and then making a PUT request to  ``/api/auth/login`` with that cookie and the correct password in the JSON body of the request.  Once the ``sid`` (Session ID) is authorized any of the endpoints which require authorization may be accessed by providing the ``bbctrl-sid`` cookie.  Only those endpoints which specify the possibility of a 401 return code in the API documentation require authorization.  See [https://api.buildbotics.com/\#tag/authorization/PUT/auth/login](https://api.buildbotics.com/#tag/authorization/PUT/auth/login).
